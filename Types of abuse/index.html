    <h1 align="center">Signs of Abuse</h1>
    Abuse can come in many different ways, below we will have a look at the most common ones.
<br>
    If you feel like you’re being abused, there’s a good chance you may be, and it’s worth getting help. Keep that in mind as you think about these signs:
<div>
  <br>
 <span id="text">Your partner bullies, threatens, or controls you:

Create a code word with your trust person/group so that people are aware when
you are needing help.
If you have neighbours that can help, you can also develop a visual signal that will
alert them should you be in distress. Examples of visual signals could be switching
an outside light on and off several times, or tying a piece of material around the
railing of a fence or a tree or around/on anything that is visible from the outside of
your house. Agree with your neighbor about what type of assistance is needed
depending on the visual signal. For example, a piece of red material could signal
that you need your neighbor to contact the police. White material could signal that
you need your neighbor to create a diversion such as ringing your doorbell or
calling your cellphone/landline.
If you have children, and they are old enough to understand, discuss this plan with
them too.

<h1 align="center">Physical Abuse</h1>
If you’re afraid of your partner, that’s a big red flag.
<br>
You may be scared to say what you think, to bring up certain topics, or to say no to sex. No matter the reason, fear has no place in a healthy relationship.<br>

If a person regularly has injuries, there seems to be a pattern to the injuries or the explanation doesn't match the injuries, then this should be reported.
<div>
<br>
<span id="text">Some signs of physical abuse include:


Black eyes
Bruises on the arms
Busted lips
Red or purple marks on the neck
Sprained wrists
It's also common for someone to try to cover up the physical signs with clothing. For example, you may notice that someone you care about is wearing long sleeves or scarves in the hot summer. Wearing heavier than normal makeup or donning sunglasses inside are also common signs of domestic abuse.

Abuse occurs when one person in a relationship attempts to dominate and control the other person. Usually, the control begins with psychological or emotional abuse, then escalates to physical abuse. When domestic abuse includes physical violence, it's termed domestic violence.<br>

Threatens to kill you or someone close to you
Throws things or punches walls when angry
Yells at you and makes you feel small

<h1 align="center">Sexual Abuse</h1>
Sexual abuse can happen to both adults and minors.<br> It has long term effects on the victim, below are some of the ways it manifests:

<div>
<br>
<span id="text">Your partner bullies, threatens, or controls you:

Sexual abuse happens when someone forces or entices a child or young person to take part in sexual activity, either directly or as an observer, via the internet or when photos are taken and sent on mobile phones.

Sexual abuse can include inappropriate touching, oral sex, sexual intercourse, exposing children to pornography, using a child in the production of pornography or luring children through the internet for sexual purposes.

Sexual abusers can be anyone including family members, close friends, carers and people working with children. Most often the sexual abuser is known to the child.

Sexual abuse can happen anywhere— in homes, at school, at camps, on transport and in care situations.

Trust your own knowledge and gut feelings about your child and note any changes to their body or behaviour.

Your partner sexually abuses you:

Forces you to have sex

Makes you dress in a sexual way

Makes you feel like you owe them sex

Tries to give you an STD

Won’t use condoms or other birth control

discomfort when going to the toilet

inflammation and infection of genital areas

frequent urinary tract infections/bowel problems

getting a sexually transmitted disease

pregnancy.
